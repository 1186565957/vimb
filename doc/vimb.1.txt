.SH NAME
PROJECT \- A modal web browser based on webkit thats inspired by vim the great editor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "PROJECT [" "OPTION" "] [" "URI" "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION

browsing-experience.

.SH COMMANDS
Commands are a central part in PROJECT. They are used for nearly all things
that could be done with this browser. Commands allow to set config variables,
to assign keybindings and much more. Also the keybindings are only shortcut
for the commands itself.

Commands can be called in Insert Mode from the inputbox in the way like
":[count]command[ param[=value]]". But some commands are not available in
Command Mode and therefore not callable directly. To use them too, they must be
bound to the keybinding.

For example the command "hint-focus-next" is only available in hinting mode.
To call it, it has to be bound to a key like "hmap <tab>=hint-focus-next" to
be used.

.SS Keybinding
To bind a command to a key sequence use the {n,i,c,h}map command. To map a
keysequence to a command, use this format "nmap {[modkey]key}={command}[ params]".

The modkey is a single simple char like "g". The key can also contain
special keys and modifiers and is given in format like "<ctrl-o>", "<tab>",
"<shift-tab>" or also a simple char like "G".

Example:
.br
"hmap <shift-tab>=hint-focus-prev" to add focus next in in Hinting Mode.
.br
"nmap <shift-?>=input :foo" to write :foo into input box and switch to Command Mode.
.br
"hunmap <shift-tab>" To remove this keybinding use.

If a keybinding is added, for the same key-sequence like another keybinding,
the later added have precedence. If a keybinding is removed only that with the
highest precedence will be removed and all other will still be active.
