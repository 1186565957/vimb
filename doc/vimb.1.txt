.SH NAME
PROJECT - Vim Browser - A modal web browser based on webkit thats inspired by
vim the great editor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "PROJECT [" "OPTION" "] [" "URI" "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
PROJECT is a webkit based web browser that behaves like the vimperator
plugin for the firefox and usage paradigms from the great editor vim. The goal
of PROJECT is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and pleasurable
browsing-experience.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \--config " "CONFIG-FILE"
Use custom configuration given as \fICONFIG-FILE\fP.

.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Show help options.
.TP
.B "\-d, \-\-dump-config"

create a own config file in
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/PROJECT/config
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-version"

.SH MODES
PROJECT is modal an has following main modes:
.TP
.B Normal Mode
The default mode. Pressing Escape always enter normal mode.
.TP
.B Insert Mode
Used for editing text elements in a webpage.
.TP
.B Command Mode
Execute PROJECT commands from the builtin inputbox (commandline).
.SH COMMANDS
Commands are a central part in PROJECT. They are used for nearly all things
that could be done with this browser. Commands allow to set config variables,
to assign keybindings and much more. Also the keybindings are only shortcut
for the commands itself.

Commands can be called in Insert Mode from the inputbox in the way like
":[count]command[ param[=value]]". But some commands are not available in
Command Mode and therefore not callable directly. To use them too, they must be
bound to the keybinding.

For example the command "hint-focus-next" is only available in hinting mode.
To call it, it has to be bound to a key like "hmap <tab>=hint-focus-next" to
be used.

.SS Open

.SS Keybinding
To bind a command to a key sequence use the {n,i,c}map command. To map a
keysequence to a command, use this format "nmap {[modkey]key}={command}[ params]".

The modkey is a single simple char like "g". The key can also contain
special keys and modifiers and is given in format like "<ctrl\-o>", "<tab>",
"<shift\-tab>", "<up>", "<right>" or also a simple char like "G".

Example:
.br
"nmap <shift\-?>=input :foo" to write :foo into input box and switch to Command Mode.
.br
"hunmap <shift\-tab>" To remove this keybinding use.

If a keybinding is added, for the same key-sequence like another keybinding,
the later added have precedence. If a keybinding is removed only that with the
highest precedence will be removed and all other will still be active.
.TP
