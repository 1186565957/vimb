.SH NAME
vimb - Vim Browser - A modal web browser based on webkit, inspired by vim the
great editor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "vimb [" "OPTION" "] [" "URI" "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
vimb is a webkit based web browser that behaves like the vimperator
plugin for the firefox and usage paradigms from the great editor vim. The goal
of vimb is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and pleasurable
browsing-experience.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \--config " "CONFIG-FILE"
Use custom configuration given as \fICONFIG-FILE\fP.

by vimb, all other keystrokes are given to the webview to handle them. This
allows to use websites that uses keybindings itself, that might be swallowed
by vimb else.

Some of the Normal Model Commands can have a numeric count to multiply the
effect of the command. If a command supports the count this is shown as
\fB[N]\fP.

.SS Hinting
The hinting is the way to do what you would do with the mouse in common
mouse-driven browsers. Open URI, yank URI, save page and so on. If the hinting
is started, the relevant elements on the page will be marked by numbered
labels. Hints can be selected by using <Tab>, <C-I> or <C-Tab>, <C-O>, by
typing the number of the label, or filtering the elements by some text that is
part of the hinted element (like URI, link text, button label) and any
combination of this methods. If <enter> is pressed, the current active hint
will be fired. If only one possible hint remains, this will be fired
automatically.

.BI Syntax: " ;{mode}{hint}"

Start hint mode. Different elements depending on \fImode\fP are highlighted
and numbered. Elements can be selected either by typing their number, or by
typing part of their text (\fIhint\fP) to narrow down the result. When an
element has been selected, it is automatically clicked or used (depending on
\fImode\fP) and hint mode ends.

The filtering of hints by text splits the query at ' ' and use the single parts
as separate queries to filter the hints. This is useful for hints that have a
lot of filterable chars in common and it needs many chars to make a distinct
selection. For example ';ove to' will easily select the second hint out of
{'very long link text one', 'very long link text two'}.
.RS 0

.IP \fB<CR>\fP

Open the give \fIURI\fP into a new window. If \fIURI\fP is empty the

.SS Key Mapping
Key mappings allow to alter actions of key presses. Each key mapping is
associated with a mode and only has effect when the mode is active. Following
commands allow the user to substitute one sequence of key presses by another.

.BI Syntax: " :{m}map {lhs} {rhs}"
Note that the \fIlhs\fP ends with the first found space. If you want to use
space also in the {lhs} you have to escape this with a single `\\' like shown
in the examples.
.RS 0
Standard key mapping commands are provided for these modes \fIm\fP:
.IP \fBn\fP
Normal mode: When browsing normally.
.IP \fBi\fP
Insert mode: When interacting with text fields on a website.
.IP \fBc\fP
Command Line mode: When typing into the vimbs command line.
.RE
Most keys in key sequences are represented simply by the character that you
see on the screen when you type them. However, as a number of these characters
have special meanings, and a number of keys have no visual representation, a
special notation is required.

As special key names have the format \fI<...>\fP. Following special keys can
be used <Left>, <Up>, <Right>, <Down> for the cursor keys, <Tab>, <Esc>, <CR>,
<F1>-<F12> and <C-A>-<C-Z>.
.TP
.BI ":nm[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":im[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
.TP
.BI ":cm[ap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }
Map the key sequence \fIlhs\fP to \fIrhs\fP for the modes where the map
command applies. The result, including \fIrhs\fP, is then further scanned for
mappings. This allows for nested and recursive use of mappings.

.RS
Example:
.IP ":cmap <C-G>h /home/user/downloads/"
Adds a keybind to insert a file path into the input box. This could be useful
for the `:save' command that could be used as ":save ^Gh".
.IP ":nmap <F1> :set scripts=on<CR>:open !glib<Tab><CR>"
This will enable scripts and lookup the first bookmarked URI with the tag
`glib' and open it immediately if F1 key is pressed.
.IP ":nmap \\\\\ \\\\\  50G;o"
Example which mappes two spaces to go to 50% of the page, start hinting mode.

.TP
.BI ":cno[remap] {" lhs "} {" rhs }

mappings. Often used to redefine a command.

.BI ":nu[nmap] {" lhs }
.TP
.BI ":iu[nmap] {" lhs }
.TP
.BI ":cu[nmap] {" lhs }

Save the current opened URI with \fITAGS\fP to the bookmark file.
.TP
.BI ":bmr [" URI ]

.SS Shortcuts
Shortcuts allows to open URI build up from a named template with additional
parameters. If a shortcut named 'dd' is defined, you can use it with `:open dd
list of parameters' to open the generated URI.

Shortcuts are a good to use with search engines where the URI is nearly the
same but a single parameter is user defined.
.TP
.BI ":shortcut-add " "SHORTCUT" "=" "URI"
Adds a shortcut with the \fISHORTCUT\fP and \fIURI\fP template. The \fIURI\fP
can contain multiple placeholders $0-$9 that will be filled by the parameters
given when the shortcut is called. The parameters given when the shortcut is
called will be split into as many parameters like the highest used
placeholder.

.RS
Examples:
.IP ":shortcut-add dl=https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=$0"
to setup a search engine. Can be called by `:open dl my search phrase'.
.IP ":shortcut-add gh=https://github.com/$0/$1"

.TP
.BI ":shortcut-remove " "SHORTCUT"

":open foo bar<Tab>" will complete only URIs that contain the words foo and
bar.
.TP
.B bookmarks
The bookmark completion is similar to the history completion, but does match
only the tags of the bookmarks. The bookmark completion ist started by `:open
\fB!\fP` or `:tabopen \fB!\fP` and does a prefix search for all given words in
the bookmark tags.

Example:
":open \fB!\fPfoo ba" will match all bookmark that have the tags "foo" or
