.SH NAME
vimp \- A modal web browser based on webkit thats inspired by vim the great editor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "vimp [" "OPTION" "] [" "URI" "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vimp
is a webkit based web browser that behaves like the vimperator
plugin for the firefox and usage paradigms from the great editor vim. The goal
of vimp is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and pleasurable
browsing-experience.

.SH MODES

.SH COMMANDS
Commands are a central part in vimp. They are used for nearly all things
that could be done with this browser. Commands allow to set config variables,
to assign keybindings and much more. Also the keybindings are only shortcut
for the commands itself.

Commands can be called in Insert Mode from the inputbox in the way like
":[count]command[ param[=value]]". But some commands are not available in
Command Mode and therefore not callable directly. To use them too, they must be
bound to the keybinding.

For example the command "hint-focus-next" is only available in hinting mode.
To call it, it has to be bound to a key like "hmap <tab>=hint-focus-next" to
be used.
